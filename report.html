    <p style="background: fixed; text-align: center;"><em><strong>Nature</strong> is the endless expanse of life forms,
            beauty,
            resources, peace and
            nourishment.<br> Every bud that grows
            to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly<br> and every infant who faces the
            world
            as
            a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature.<br>In addition to providing resources for our daily
            needs
            of
            food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and manufacturing units.<br>
            Paper,
            furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical units, etc. all derive their
            basic
            components from nature.</em></p>
